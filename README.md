# ATG Technical Assignment: Self-Healing Classification DAG  
**Machine Learning Intern Deliverable**

A LangGraph-based classification pipeline that performs sentiment analysis with a **self-healing fallback mechanism**. When prediction confidence is low, the system asks for human clarification â€” ensuring reliability over blind automation.

Built using:
- Fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased` on IMDB dataset
- LoRA (PEFT) for efficient training
- LangGraph for DAG workflow
- CLI interface with structured logging
